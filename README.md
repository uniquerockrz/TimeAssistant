This is the stable branch for TimeAssistant, for nightly builds, please see master branch

TimeAssistant is a minimalist, intelligent, sexy and smart (MISS) ;-)  life planner for your day to day needs. The trouble with other calender and time management apps is that they *need to be told* that you want to do this work at this time. This is dumb, and we are overcoming this problem by creating this smart life management app. Most of us follow routine tasks everyday, so create categories of tasks, make your routine and plans and TimeAssistant will just tell you what to do when, Like A Boss! Create deadline on tasks, set tasks priorities and set it and forget it. Got a party at friday evening? Create a event and TimeAssistant will automatically reschedule your tasks on a later date.

We are planning to support a hell lot of features like import from Google calendar, mobile apps, email and SMS alerts and more. With an extension framework coming soon, you will not be able to manage just your time, but also your budget, academics, health and fitness and every aspect of your life.

For the time being, our priority is ~~a easy installation script and~~ porting it to QCubed framework for better RAD. If you want to be a developer of the best time and life management app ever, clone it, solve the issues and I may give you repo access.

I know it looks bare as if websites of 90s era, but thats where its sexiness is. Inspite of capable of doing complicated management tasks, TimeAssistant looks simple and very user friendly.

To Install:

1. Clone the repo in /var/www or your document root of apache.
2. Create empty database using PHPmyadmin.
3. Change db host, database name, user and pass in includes/dbaccess.php
4. From browser navigate to localhost/TimeAssistant/install.php
